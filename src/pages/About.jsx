    <p>
      This simple React application demonstrates an oddly satisfying animation of pulsing circles.
      It is built with React functional components, CSS animations, and React Router for navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to create visually pleasing, smooth animations that can be customized in real-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore the Home page and tweak the animation colors and speed!
